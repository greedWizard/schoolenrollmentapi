Each user has passed 3 exams and reached scores on that, also he has an additional info such as phone number to contact on him and first/last name as well.
There is an exam model that contains id and title fields.

The interface should allow you to send post/get/put/delete requests to the server and CRUD any objects for enrollment managemant.
By requesting /enrolled url you can get top students. Also you can specify faculty or specialization by typing enrolled/[Faculty title].
